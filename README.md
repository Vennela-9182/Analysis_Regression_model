# Analysis_Regression_model
## This project explores different regression techniques to predict rock density using X-ray signal strength (in nHz). The data comes from a tunnel-boring company that uses X-rays to estimate the density of rocks. Knowing the density helps them decide when to switch boring heads before drilling through harder rock layers.
## Interestingly, the relationship between signal strength and rock density shows a sine-wave-like pattern, and the researchers are still investigating the reason behind this oscillating behavior
